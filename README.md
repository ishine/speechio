Zen
* all codes are debt, less code means exponentially less interests to pay over time
* be simple, don't add complexity to prove you are smart, it's stupid
* be explicit, stealth behaviors behind non-obvious codes are evil
* be local, codes and information should be organized in a way that can be read & checked locally
* abuse of abstractions brings cognitive and runtime costs, abstract only when it is absolutely necessary
* if a variable can be made shorter without ambiguity, then make it shorter
