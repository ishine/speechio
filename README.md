# SpeechIO Operations

## Zen
* Keep it small. Codes are debts, less code means less interests to pay.
* Keep it simple. Avoid complexity for "being cool".
* Keep it explicit. Hidden behaviors behind non-obvious codes are evil.
* Keep it local. Things should be organized locally for easy understanding.
* Keep it concrete. Unnecessary abstractions bring cognitive costs, abstract only when it is absolutely necessary.
* Keep it concise. If a variable name can be made shorter without ambiguity, then it should be made shorter.
