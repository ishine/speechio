Zen
* Keep it small. Codes are debts, less code means less interests to pay
* Keep it simple. Avoid complexity for "being smart"
* Keep it explicit. Hidden behaviors behind non-obvious codes are evil
* Keep it local. Codes and info should be organized in a way that can be read & checked locally
* Keep it concrete. Unnecessary abstractions bring cognitive costs, abstract only when it is absolutely necessary
* Keep it concise. If a variable can be made shorter without ambiguity, then make it shorter.
